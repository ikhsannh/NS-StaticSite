# Building Static Site (Landing Page, Product List and so on) using Next.js

Hey, everyone! 👋 [I'm Ikhsan](https://nashkispace.gitlab.io/), Perform Indipendent Web Developer. This project was originally released in 2023.

I've updated the project overview below to annotate which parts are up to date, which have changed, and which have done. In my opinion, this is the ideal way to _Learn_ and _evolve_. The project will serve as a reference to a point in time. I'll continue to update the project as I learn more.

- 🟢 **Done**

- 🔵 **Update**

## Introduction

- Each project is in its own branch, such as this one, which is in the landing-page branch, and the product list project is in the branch [product-list](https://gitlab.com/nashkispace/NS-LandingPage/-/tree/product-list).

I taught Class Components in 2019 for those still in the process of converting to React Hooks. In 2021, it's now standard to use React Hooks for all projects and I would recommend starting there.
